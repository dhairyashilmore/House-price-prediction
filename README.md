House Price Prediction : 
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, we can estimate property values and provide insights into the housing market. The model uses a linear regression approach to analyze the relationships between features and prices.
